# Project Constitution (Phase 3)

This file exists to satisfy Spec-Kit requirements.
For full runtime rules, see `phase3/CLAUDE.md`.

- Phase 3 extends Phase 2 backend (CRUD + Better Auth).
- All development is spec-driven using Spec-Kit Plus.
- Agents, skills, and MCP tools follow CLAUDE.md rules.
- Reusable skills from `.claude/skills/` provide implementation templates.
- MCP tools wrap Phase 2 backend; skills guide agent behavior.
